    "Import Libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "The script imports the Image class from the PIL (Pillow) library to handle image loading and saving.\n",
    "It also imports the numpy library to manipulate image data as arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encrypt Image Function (encrypt_image):\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Open the image: The image at input_path is opened and converted to RGB mode to ensure it has three color channels (Red, Green, Blue).\n",
    "    2. Convert to numpy array: The image is converted to a NumPy array (np_img). This array has dimensions (height, width, 3), where the third dimension corresponds to the RGB channels.\n",
    "    3. Encrypt pixels: The pixel values are modified by adding the key value and taking the result modulo 256. This ensures that the pixel values remain within the valid range [0, 255].\n",
    "    4. Convert back to image: The modified NumPy array (np_encrypted) is converted back to an image.\n",
    "    5. Save the encrypted image: The encrypted image is saved to the specified output_path.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decrypt Image Function (decrypt_image):\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Open the encrypted image: The encrypted image at input_path is opened and converted to RGB mode.\n",
    "    2. Convert to numpy array: The image is converted to a NumPy array (np_img).\n",
    "    3. Decrypt pixels: The pixel values are reverted by subtracting the key value and taking the result modulo 256.\n",
    "    4. Convert back to image: The modified NumPy array (np_decrypted) is converted back to an image.\n",
    "    5. Save the decrypted image: The decrypted image is saved to the specified output_path.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The script specifies the input image path (input_image_path), the encrypted image output path (encrypted_image_path), and the decrypted image output path (decrypted_image_path).\n",
    "    2. An encryption key (encryption_key) is set to 50.\n",
    "    3. The script then calls the encrypt_image function to encrypt the image and save it.\n",
    "    After encryption, it calls the decrypt_image function to decrypt the image and save it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Encryption: Each pixel's value in the image is increased by 50. If the pixel value plus 50 exceeds 255, the modulo operation ensures it wraps around and stays within the range 0-255.\n",
    "    2. Decryption: Each pixel's value in the encrypted image is decreased by 50. The modulo operation ensures that any negative values wrap around correctly to stay within the range 0-255.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Running the Script:\n",
    "    1. Make sure the Pillow and NumPy libraries are installed.\n",
    "    2. Place the image you want to encrypt at the specified input_image_path.\n",
    "    3. Run the script. It will save the encrypted image to encrypted_image_path and the decrypted image to decrypted_image_path."
